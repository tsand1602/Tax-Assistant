# Tax-Assistant

Tax Assistant that verifies PAN IDs and calculates taxes

This project simulates a Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) system with an AI assistant that interacts with a third-party API (ClearTax) to calculate income tax.  It's a simplified demonstration of how a company can deduct TDS from employee salaries and remit it to the government.
