# Tax-Assistant

Tax Assistant that verifies PAN IDs and calculates taxes

This project simulates a Income Tax Calculator system with an AI assistant that interacts with a third-party API (API Ninja) to calculate income tax. It has also incorporated a LLM powered by Gemini that can answer the user's tax related queries. It's a simplified demonstration of how a company can deduct tax from the salaries of employees and remit it to the government.
